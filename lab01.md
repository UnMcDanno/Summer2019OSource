10 Criteria of Open Source Definition
------
* Why important?
    These criterias protect both the author's right of reserving the 'ownershiop' and users' rights of freely (both economically and applicably), meanwhile ensuring the economic won't envolve so that every potential user could approach the resource and creating potential projects.
    
Smart Questions
-----
* Do you have more suggestions for How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way (from your past experience)?
  <br>1. If the question code was posted, try to fix the code instead of just typing with literal discription of the possible solution/fixation.<\br>
   <br>2.If you tried and could not solve the question, post what you have tried to save the newcomers time or probably to provide sparklings.<\br>
   
   
Free Culture Ch.3
-----
* Write a short paragraph ( 8 to 10 sentences) of what you got out of reading that chapter.
    The first thing I learnt is definitely to go throught RIAA laws before beginning any likely related projects. The other thing is that, laws about open source hasn't yet developed flawlessly (but I didn't know the State law well the following will just be a guess) . For instance, the law question for Jesse was who indeed should take the responsibility of break the property law? The search engine developer Microsoft? These who uploaded the music files? Or Jesse the one who has proceeded the files and allow them to be uploaded? In my point of view, as long as open source keeps developing, the law issue could not be avoided because though the 10 criterias work for open source, they cannot be applied to modern law. Nevertheless, this is not a simple problem that can be solved in a short time,  therefore to save ourselves, the best way is to read through corresponed laws before starting the coding.

Open Source Project Reflection
-------
* Project "Making your Own Image filter"
    url: http://aosabook.org/en/500L/making-your-own-image-filters.html
    
    I'm right know studying TensorFlow with my friends trying to code out a program that could indicate different languanges. However, during the process, I've also noticed that TensorFlow is well-performanced in the field of image analysis, which drew me interests of AI on image processing. Therefore, this open source project attrated me at once. I hope this article could give me an overview about the Java on image processing. By reading through and working to understand this project, I want to broaden my mind of image analyzing, including what languages could be used and what are there advantages in this field.
