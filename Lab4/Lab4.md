LICENCSE:
=========
![license](https://github.com/UnMcDanno/Summer2019OSource/blob/master/Lab4/license.png)

1) Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
  i. Give premission to use the software.
  ii. Give premission to study the software.
  iii. Give premission to modify the software.
  
2) Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
  Because without the explicit license, the user/accesser cannot know what is allowed to do with the project. If the opinion on the degree of access on this project is different between the user and the publisher,law issues might be involved and that is gonna be exhausted and money-costing.
 
3) Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher.Do you agree with this claim? 
  I agree with this claim. Hypertext is a convenient tool for both web building and web accessing, just like html5 takes place of flash gradually, lack of advanced/popular technique support, a browser won't live along. In the other hand, interface is one big thing for the wide use, normal users would apply the simple theory and choose the one that is most human-friendly and that established the importance of interface design.
  
4) Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project? (Justification for ONE choice is enough, but be specific and make sure you provide references to articles or web resources).
